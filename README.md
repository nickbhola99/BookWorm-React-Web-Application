# React Web Application Project
This web application utilizes React to create a website called BookWorm that can be used to search for books on Google Books. It uses Axios and React hooks like useState and useEffect to obtain and render information from the Google Books API, which is then displayed to the User in informative cards.
## Goal
Use React techniques to create a practical web application.
## Technologies
React Components to create a dynamic web application
React hooks to read data and pass it to other components
Axios to call the Google Books API
React Bootstrap for some styling
Font Awesome for an Icon in the navbar
